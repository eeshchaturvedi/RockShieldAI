> RockShield AI is an end-to-end safety and monitoring platform that leverages the power of multi-modal AI, physics simulations, and real-time data analytics to predict and prevent rockfall disasters in open-pit mines, safeguarding human lives and critical assets.

## üìã Problem Statement

Open-pit mining is a hazardous environment where the unpredictable nature of rockfalls poses a constant and severe threat to worker safety and expensive machinery. Traditional monitoring methods are often manual, intermittent, and fail to provide the timely, actionable intelligence needed to prevent accidents. There is a critical need for a proactive, integrated, and intelligent system that can continuously monitor slope stability and provide immediate, targeted alerts before a disaster occurs.

## üöÄ Our Proposed Solution: RockShield AI

RockShield AI addresses this challenge through a comprehensive, four-tiered approach that provides a complete safety net for mining operations.

**1. AI-Powered Risk Mapping**
We integrate multi-source data from **Drones (visual), Lidar (3D point clouds), and SAR (satellite imagery)** to create a dynamic, multi-layered risk map of the mine. Our system uses advanced algorithms to automatically identify and delineate high-risk zones based on critical factors like slope gradient, geological features, and proximity to blasting activity.

**2. Real-Time Stability Analysis**
Our system continuously ingests and analyzes live data from a network of seismic sensors. This data is fed into a sophisticated **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which acts as the 'ears' of the system, detecting subtle micro-seismic patterns that indicate internal rock stress and fracturing‚Äîoften the earliest precursors to a slope failure.

**3. Predictive Hazard Simulation**
Prediction is not enough; we must also understand the potential impact. When a high-risk area is identified, RockShield AI proactively runs **3D physics-based simulations using the Bullet Physics engine**. This allows us to calculate the potential trajectory, energy, and impact zone of a rockfall, transforming a vague threat into a clear, visualizable danger assessment.

**4. Instant, Targeted Multi-Channel Alerts**
The moment a threat is confirmed by our AI and simulation models, the system triggers an automated alert cascade. Alerts are sent instantly to exposed workers via **SMS, email, and on-site sirens**. By leveraging GPS-based worker tracking, our alerts are targeted, ensuring that only those in the specific danger zone are notified, minimizing unnecessary disruption and maximizing effectiveness.

**5. Centralized Zone Management & Monitoring**
Mine managers have access to a central dashboard built with **React**. This platform allows for registering mine-specific areas, managing worker details, and monitoring all sensor data and AI-driven insights in real-time through an interactive 2D/3D interface.
